**Please provide links to at least 3 websites you have developed (both front-end and back-end), along with a brief description of your role in each project.**

I worked on https://mavtechglobal.com as a full stack developer on the PetroPages Industrial Marketing Team. The wordpress site has over 1,000 pages, HubSpot integration, HR Portal, Organic SEO, PPC Campaign, Google ReMarketing, and more!

The https://smilefactorypediatricdentistry.com website was built by myself using a combination of custom coded HTML, CSS, SASS, Javascript, JSON, and PHP. The functionality of the site has been extended with open source softwares Easy!Appointments for automated appointment booking/confirmations and Mautic for automated marketing. The site has more than tripled the business revenue due to an aggressive Local Organic SEO strategy.

I made the https://umachrishenley.com website all by myself in one week since the project budget only allowed for a week of my work. The site has Square secure transactions, Square Appointment Bookings, and a custom coded front-end. The automated nature of appointment booking with eCommerce transactions has allowed Uma to scale the business massively.

**Explain your experience with WordPress Multisite installations and child themes. How have you utilized these tools in past projects, and what challenges have you faced with them?**

I’ve worked with WordPress Multisite, setting up and managing networks for clients who need multiple sites under one system. I’ve also built and customized child themes to keep things flexible and maintainable while adding custom features. Some challenges I’ve dealt with include plugin conflicts across a network, database quirks, and making sure updates don’t break customizations. I always focus on keeping things scalable, optimized, and easy for clients to manage all while providing easy to follow documentation.

**How do you approach optimizing a WordPress website for speed, security, and SEO? Can you provide an example of a project where you made significant improvements in these areas?**

When optimizing a WordPress site, I focus on three key areas:

Speed: I optimize images, enable caching (via plugins like WP Rocket), use a CDN, and minimize CSS/JS. I also fine-tune database queries and choose a solid hosting provider.

Security: I implement strong login protections, use security plugins (like Wordfence), set up regular backups, and ensure themes/plugins are always updated.

SEO: I optimize on-page elements (titles, meta descriptions, schema markup), improve site structure, and use SEO plugins like Yoast or Rank Math.

One project I worked on was for an e-commerce site struggling with slow load times and poor search rankings. After optimizing images, reducing unused scripts, and switching to a better hosting plan, load times improved by over 50%. I also tightened security settings, preventing frequent bot attacks. On the SEO side, restructuring content and improving metadata helped boost organic traffic by 40% in the first three months.

**Describe your experience designing and developing WordPress websites from start to finish. What is your typical process from initial design through site launch, and how do you ensure quality at each stage?**

I’ve designed and developed numerous WordPress websites from the ground up, handling everything from planning to launch. My typical process includes:

1. Discovery & Planning – I start by understanding the client’s goals, audience, and key features needed. This includes wireframing and selecting the right theme or deciding on a custom build.

2. Design & Development – I either customize a theme or build from scratch, ensuring mobile responsiveness, accessibility, and clean code. I also integrate necessary plugins and optimize for performance.

3. Content & SEO – I structure content effectively, optimize for SEO (meta tags, schema, etc.), and ensure fast load times.

4. Testing & QA – I thoroughly test for responsiveness, browser compatibility, security vulnerabilities, and overall performance.

5. Launch & Training – After final client approval, I handle deployment, set up backups, and provide training on site management.

To ensure quality, I use staging environments, perform thorough testing, and follow best practices for speed, security, and SEO. This approach ensures a smooth launch and long-term site success.
