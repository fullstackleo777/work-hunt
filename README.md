Work hunt content for FullStackLeo
___
This project serves as a work diary of my efforts to get more remote full stack developer jobs.

**Strategy:**
1. Apply to remote jobs on Indeed, Monster, ZipRecruiter, LinkedIn, GitHub, WeWorkRemotely, and RemoteOK using job role targed resumes
2. Save the job listing as a PDF inside this repo with the naming convention: ID_Date_Job-Listing-Location_Employer_Employee-Role_Extra-Info
3. Record a sequential list of the saved PDF names along with the action taken underneath
4. Record any further follow up details under the PDF names and actions taken.

Let's see how this plays out!
